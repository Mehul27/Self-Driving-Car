# Self-Driving-Car

My first try at Self Driving Car.

Check out the video for predicted steering angles at https://youtu.be/dToEcbyKkC8

This project is purely completed for learning purposes.

Used NVIDIA's architecture published in this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316v1.pdf for predicting steering angles based on the front camera view of a car. 
Made some minor changes to the architecture like added dropouts for fully connected layers and added an extra fully connected layer.

Next: Planning to use data augmentation to optimize model's performance.

Stay tuned for more information and full references.
